An Opportunity is a qualified Sales prospect with a likely chance that
they will be able to do business with your company. You have established
that they have buying power and have entered into the buying cycle. This
module allows you to track your Opportunities throughout the Sales
Pipeline until the deal is 'Closed Lost' or 'Closed Won'.

== Opportunities Actions

You can access the Opportunities actions from the Opportunities module
menu drop down or via the Sidebar. The Opportunities actions are as
follows:

* *Create Opportunity* – A new form is opened in Edit View to allow you to
create a new Account record.
* *View Opportunities* – Redirects you to the List View for the
Opportunities module. This allows you to search and list Opportunity
records.
* *Import Opportunities* – Redirects you to the Import Wizard for the
Opportunities module. For more information, see
